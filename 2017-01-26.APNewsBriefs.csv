2017-01-26-13-09-12,Mexican president cancels planned DC meeting with Trump,"MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Thursday canceled a planned Jan. 31 meeting with President Donald J. Trump, hours after Trump tweeted that the meeting should be scrapped if Mexico won't pay for a border wall. Pena Nieto's message on Twitter ended days of uncertainty about how he would respond to Trump's aggressive stance toward the country, and illustrated the challenges world leaders are likely to face in dealing with Trump's voluble, Twitter-based diplomacy. It also signaled a remarkable souring of relations between the U.S. and its immediate southern neighbor, one of America's largest trading partners and a country with which it shares a nearly 2,000-mile border.",MEXICO CITY,http://hosted.ap.org//dynamic/stories/L/LT_MEXICO_TRUMP?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2017-01-26-13-09-12

The 35-year-old Williams arrived in Australia bidding for a 23rd Grand Slam title, aiming to break the Open-era record she shares with Steffi Graf. By winning, she'd also regain the No. 1 ranking she lost after her U.S. Open semifinal exit. She doesn't enjoy the suspense, or talk about the number. Her older sister, Venus, knows that better than anyone after their two decades of competing together in the majors. Now the 36-year-old Venus is the potential roadblock, back in a major final for the first time since she lost the previous all-Williams Grand Slam final at Wimbledon in 2009.","MELBOURNE, Australia",http://hosted.ap.org//dynamic/stories/T/TEN_AUSTRALIAN_OPEN?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2017-01-26-10-44-40
